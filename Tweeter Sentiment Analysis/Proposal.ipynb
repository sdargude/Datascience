A twetter user's timeline consists of tweets or retweets  or likes from the people they follow. Often some the tweets are promoted by Tweeter based on user's behaviour."

    "In general, emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. There are two main goals of the proposed system, firstly, detect the sentiments of the tweets on users timeline and give an overall sentiment score for the timeline. The second goal,is the predict the sentiement of the tweet which user may like or generate based on the overall sentitments of the timeline."
